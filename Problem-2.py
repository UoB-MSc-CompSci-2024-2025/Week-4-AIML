# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
# Because these are aligned, it means that the logical inference of our KB and Y functions are correct;
# the variable 'entails' as seen in the model_check() function therefore returns True
# If there was any variation, it would mean that our logical inference of these statements was incorrect and it would return False
